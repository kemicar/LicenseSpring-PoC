# LicenseSpring API Client with SSL/TLS Support - ESP32 board (Arduino)

This project was part of my onboarding as a **student**. The goal was to establish **HTTPS** communication with the LicenseSpring server on an ESP32 board and perform license activation and license check. The actual code is written in C++ and follows the Arduino structure, utilizing libraries and functions suitable for microcontroller programming.

## Key features 
LicenseSpring API Integration
* Directly connect with LicenseSpring's API to activate and deactivate software licenses. This feature streamlines license management, making it more efficient and effective.
HTTPS with SSL/TLS Encryption 
* Ensuring the security of data transmission, our project utilizes HTTPS requests combined with SSL/TLS encryption. 
* 
User-Friendly Web Interface
* Manage your certificates and license keys using server running on the board
